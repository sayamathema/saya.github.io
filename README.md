# Kanban History: From 1950s Factory Floor to Today’s Remote Teams
####
Work is constantly changing. Projects multiply across the business and become programs. Programs get grouped into portfolios, and [management](https://www.toptal.com/project-managers/scaled-agile-framework/safe-best-practices) practices become increasingly complex as organizations grow and begin to operate at scale. Even something as simple as an office presence is no longer a given.

Project managers are routinely tasked with handling uncertainty, to the point that adaptability is a core competency for the profession. Throughout all of this complexity, Kanban has remained a keystone of the management world for more than 60 years, enabling project professionals to maintain a clear, high-level view of processes.

It’s easy to see why Kanban has become an essential project management tool. As a lightweight and adaptable workflow method, it offers fit-for-purpose solutions that I’ve applied on projects across diverse industries, ranging from finance to energy to consumer markets. Kanban is capable of handling workflows on its own, but is particularly suited to being hybridized with other frameworks, scaling to an enterprise level, or even serving as the bridge to take organizations from Waterfall to Agile processes.

The 2022 State of Agile Report shows an explosive growth in the use of Kanban—up from 7% of respondents in 2020 to 56% in 2022. Considering the global shift to remote work that happened in 2020, part of that increase is no doubt due to Kanban use by remote teams.

**That said, even with many businesses going hybrid or returning to the office, Kanban is still increasing in popularity. According to the most recent State of Kanban Report, 41% of organizations are applying Kanban across more than 10 teams, with 86% of respondents planning to expand their Kanban initiatives in 2023. Understanding the history of the Kanban system will help you gain a deeper understanding of why it’s so popular, and how to best leverage it for your projects.** 

## Kanban System History: The Beginning
#### 
Kanban history has its origins in the Toyota Production System (TPS) invented by Taiichi Ohno. A director who had come up through the machine shop, Ohno sought to eliminate waste on the production line. Two of the areas he identified were overproduction and inventory: It was wasteful to make too many cars, but also wasteful to have unused raw materials sitting on the factory floor. His solution drew inspiration from supermarket operations, where food is stocked according to demand.

Applying this principle to factory production proved relatively simple: For each new car, a card containing instructions and supply information would be attached to the product during assembly, and move with it throughout the production process. Once the car was sold, the card would be returned to the start of the chain. When a predetermined number of cards were waiting to be reassigned to a product, this would signal the need for new cars to enter production, triggering an order of materials from the warehouse. The cards, named kanbans after the Japanese word for signboard, provided a visual aid to track a task from start to finish. By 1963, Kanban was in use at all Toyota plants. The manufacturing industry at large would take notice of the method and decades later, these principles would be applied to software development.
